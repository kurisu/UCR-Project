Developmental Estimates of Subnational Crime Rates Based on the National
Crime Victimization Survey presents rates of violent and property crime
victimization for the 50 states and select metropolitan statistical areas,
generated using small-"area estimation (SAE) methods. The report describes
the statistical modeling approach used to produce state-"level estimates
from the National Crime Victimization Survey data and auxiliary data
sources. It compares SAE victimization rates for the 50 states from 1999 to
2013 to FBI crime rates from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. It
shows trends in criminal victimization rates for each state from 1999 to
2013. State-"level estimates of intimate partner violence are also
presented.

BJS released a solicitation to conduct the 2016 National Survey of Tribal
Law Enforcement Agencies, which is the first BJS statistical collection
that targets Bureau of Indian Affairs agencies and tribal law enforcement
agencies in the lower 48 States and Alaska. BJS also convened a panel of
justice professionals from State, local, and tribal law enforcement
agencies and prosecutor offices for the purpose of informing the planning
and development of two surveys of State and local justice agencies that
service tribal lands. Data collection for the National Survey of Tribal
Court Systems began in February 2015. The survey found that at mid-year
2013, 2,287 inmates were confined in 79 Indian Country jails; this is a
3.3-percent decrease from mid-year 2012. At mid-year 2014, local jails held
approximately 10,400 American Indian and Alaska-Native (AIAN) inmates (1.4
percent of the total jail inmate population). During 2012, 2,482 AIAN (both
tribal and non-tribal) were arrested and booked by Federal law enforcement
agencies; 1,255 were sentenced in U.S. district courts; 1,735 entered
Federal prison, and 1,683 exited Federal prison. Data are also reported on
the number of tribal law enforcement agencies reporting crime data to the
Uniform Crime Reporting Program for 2012 and 2013. The number of tribes
receiving 2015 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants are also
reported, along with multiple funding opportunities in 2015 for improving
tribal criminal history records and reporting persons prohibited from
receiving or possessing a firearm.

This report presents data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Hate Crime
Statistics Program (HCSP) on hate crime incidents and victims from 2010 to
2019. The HCSP, which began in 1990, collects hate crime data regarding
criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias
against a race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation,
gender, or gender identity. The HCSP includes crimes reported to police
that, after investigation, reveal sufficient evidence to support being
recorded as hate crimes. The report examines incidents and victims of hate
crime recorded by law enforcement, trends over time in total hate crimes,
and hate crimes motivated by bias against the victim’s race, ethnicity, or
ancestry.

that, after investigation, reveal sufficient evidence to support being
recorded as hate crimes. The report examines incidents and victims of hate
crime recorded by law enforcement, trends over time in total hate crimes,
and hate crimes motivated by bias against the victim’s race, ethnicity, or
ancestry.

The 2016 Hooks Institute policy papers use Memphis and Shelby County as a
starting point to discuss, and propose solutions to, national issues of
race, class, and public policy. "The Long Way to a Safer Memphis: Local
Policies for Crime Prevention Need Structural Change", written by Simone
Tulumello, Ph.D. (Doctoral Research Fellow, University of Lisbon,
Portugal), looks at the need for sound structural policy changes in order
to create flourishing communities, as a reliance on the policing of
minority and poor communities will not do so. "Transportation, Urban, Form,
and Social Justice in Memphis", written by Charles A. Santo, Ph.D.
(Associate Professor, Department Chair, City and Regional Planning, UofM),
calls for us to rethink public transportation, claiming a lack of efficient
and reliable public transportation limits the ability of the poor to
improve their economic standing and harms the economic growth of Memphis
and Shelby County. "Ideology and Division: How We Got Here, How Do We Get
Back? The Search for Unity", written by Eric Groenendyk, Ph.D. (Associate
Professor, Department of Political Science, UofM), insists we are not as
politically divided as we seem; believing if we focused on communal and
individual needs, rather than ideology alone, we would find more in common
than we think.
